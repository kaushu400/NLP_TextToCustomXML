Run main method of MainParentStructure class for the execution of the program.
Input file location: src/nlp_data/nlp_data.txt, src/nlp_data/NER.txt

Output file location: src/output/fullXML.xml

Please Note:  The named entities mentioned in the NER.txt file are broken down furter by words instead of phrases.  For example, "Ernst Haeckel"
named entity is broken down into "Ernst" and "Haeckel".  So if the input text file have either word anywhere in the text, it will be 
identified as a namedEntity.  

This program will eventually fail as the input data gets largers, this can be avoided by introducing a database and storing the data in the db instead
of ArrayLists (datastructure).
